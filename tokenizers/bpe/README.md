# Byte-Level BPE Tokenizer

This code is used to train a Byte-Level Byte-Pair Encoding from scratch. The [main script](main.py) creates a new vocabulary for brazilian portuguese based on [Carolina Corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/carolina-c4ai/corpus-carolina). The vocabulary can be found in the [results](results) directory.

Other files are used to properly run the script in a docker container.
